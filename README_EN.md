## 📝 Project Introduction

**WebAI2API** is a tool that converts web-based AI services into general APIs based on **Camoufox (Playwright)**. It interacts with websites like LMArena and Gemini by simulating human operations, providing interfaces compatible with the **OpenAI format**, while supporting **multi-window concurrency** and **multi-account management** (browser instance data isolation).

### ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **Human-like Interaction**: Simulates human typing and mouse trajectories, evading automation detection through feature camouflage.
- 🔄 **API Compatibility**: Provides standard OpenAI format interfaces, supporting streaming responses and heartbeat persistence.
- 🚀 **Concurrency & Isolation**: Supports multi-window concurrent execution with independent proxy configurations, achieving browser-level data isolation for multiple accounts.
- 🛡️ **Stable Protection**: Built-in task queue, load balancing, failover, error retry, and other essential functions.
- 🎨 **Web Management**: Provides a visual management interface supporting real-time log viewing, VNC connection, adapter management, etc.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

This project supports both **source code execution** and **Docker containerized deployment**.

### 📋 Environment Requirements

- **Node.js**: v20.0.0+ (ABI 115+)
- **OS**: Windows / Linux / macOS
- **Core Dependency**: Camoufox (automatically downloaded during installation)

### 🛠️ Method 1: Manual Deployment

1. **Installation & Configuration**
   ```bash
   # 1. Install NPM dependencies
   pnpm install
   # 2. Install precompiled dependencies like the browser
   # ⚠️ This script requires connecting to GitHub to download resources. Use a proxy if network access is limited.
   npm run init 
   # Using a proxy
   # Use -proxy to interactively input proxy configuration
   npm run init -- -proxy=http://username:passwd@host:port
   ```

2. **Start Service**
   ```bash
   # Standard start
   npm start

   # Linux - Start with virtual display
   npm start -- -xvfb -vnc

   # Login mode (Temporarily forces disabling headless mode and automation)
   npm start -- -login (-xvfb -vnc)
   ```

### 🐳 Method 2: Docker Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Reminder**: 
> - The Docker image enables the virtual display (Xvfb) and VNC service by default.
> - Connection is possible via the virtual display section of the WebUI.
> - **WebUI transmission is unencrypted. Please use SSH tunneling or HTTPS in public network environments.**

**Start with Docker CLI**
```bash
docker run -d --name webai-2api \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  --shm-size=2gb \
  foxhui/webai-2api:latest
```

**Start with Docker Compose**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Adjust Configuration File

On first run, the program will copy the configuration file from `config.example.yaml` to `data/config.yaml`.

**Changes to the configuration file require a program restart to take effect!**

```yaml
server:
  # Listening port
  port: 3000
  # Authentication API Token (can be generated using npm run genkey)
  # This configuration applies to both API endpoints and the WebUI
  auth: sk-change-me-to-your-secure-key
```

> [!TIP]
> **Full Configuration Details**: Please refer to the detailed comments in [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml), or visit the [WebAI2API Documentation Center](https://foxhui.github.io/WebAI2API/en/) for a complete configuration guide.

### 2. Access Web Management Interface

After the service starts, open your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

> [!TIP]
> **Remote Access**: Replace `localhost` with your server's IP address.
> **API Token**: The authentication key configured in `auth` of the configuration file.
> **Security Suggestion**: For public network environments, it is recommended to configure HTTPS using Nginx/Caddy or access via SSH tunnel.

### 3. Initial Account Login

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The following initialization steps must be completed on first use**:

1. **Connect to Virtual Display**:
   - Linux/Docker: Connect in the "Virtual Display" section of the WebUI.
   - Windows: Operate directly in the browser window that pops up.

2. **Complete Account Login**:
   - Manually log in to the required AI website account (account requirements can be found in the WebUI's adapter management).
   - Send any message in the input box to trigger and complete human-machine verification (if required).
   - Agree to terms of service or新手 guides (if required).
   - Ensure there are no more initial use related obstructions.

3. **SSH Tunnel Connection Example** (Recommended for public servers):
   ```bash
   # Run in your local terminal to map the server's WebUI to local
   ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 root@Server_IP
   
   # Then access locally
   # WebUI: http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### Running Mode Description

> [!NOTE]
> **Regarding Headful/Headless Mode**:
> - **Headful Mode** (Default): Displays the browser window, convenient for debugging and manual intervention.
> - **Headless Mode**: Runs in the background, saves resources but interfaces cannot be viewed, and may be detected by websites.
> 
> **Recommendation**: To reduce risk, **it is strongly recommended to run in non-headless mode for the long term** (or use virtual display Xvfb).

## 🔌 API Reference

> [!TIP]
> **Detailed Documentation**: Please visit the [WebAI2API Documentation Center](https://foxhui.github.io/WebAI2API/en/) for a more comprehensive configuration guide and interface description.

### 1. OpenAI Compatible API

> [!WARNING]
> **Concurrency Limits and Streaming Keep-alive Recommendations**
> 
> This project is implemented by simulating real browser operations, and processing time may vary. When the backlog of tasks exceeds the configured amount, non-streaming requests will be rejected directly.
> 
> **💡 Highly Recommended to enable Streaming Mode**: The server will send keep-alive heartbeat packets, allowing for infinite queuing to avoid timeouts.

#### Text Chat

**Endpoint**: `POST /v1/chat/completions`

**Request Example**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-3-pro",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, please introduce yourself"}
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

#### Multimodal Requests (Text-to-Image / Image-to-Image)

**Supported Image Formats**:
- **Formats**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
- **Quantity**: Max 10 images (specific limits vary by website)
- **Data Format**: Must use Base64 Data URL format
- **Auto Conversion**: The server automatically converts all images to JPG to ensure compatibility.

#### Parameter Description

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `model` | string | ✅ | Model name, available list can be retrieved via `/v1/models` |
| `stream` | boolean | Rec. | Whether to enable streaming response, includes heartbeat keep-alive mechanism |

> [!NOTE]
> **Regarding Streaming Keep-alive (Heartbeat)**
>
> To prevent long connection timeouts, the system provides two keep-alive modes (configurable):
> 1. **Comment Mode (Default/Recommended)**: Sends `:keepalive` comments, compliant with SSE standards, best compatibility.
> 2. **Content Mode**: Sends data packets with empty content, only for special clients that must receive JSON data to reset timeouts.

### 2. Get Model List

**Endpoint**: `GET /v1/models`

**Request Example**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Get Cookies

**Description**: Utilize the project's automatic renewal feature to get the latest Cookies for use with other tools.

**Endpoint**: `GET /v1/cookies`

**Parameters**:
- `name` (Optional): Browser instance name, defaults to `default`.
- `domain` (Optional): Filter Cookies for a specific domain.

**Request Example**:
```bash
# Get cookies for a specific instance and domain
curl "http://localhost:3000/v1/cookies?name=browser_default&domain=lmarena.ai" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## 📊 Hardware Configuration Reference

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended (Single Instance) | Recommended (Multi-Instance) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CPU** | 1 Core | 2 Cores+ | 2 Cores+ |
